 A simple sudoku solver
 Written by Aidan Erickson

 This was a simple project I did to wipe some rust off programming-wise. It uses a common
 technique called 'backtracking', wherein you keep trying things until you reach an invalid
 state, where you go back. If you reach the end in a valid state, the board is valid. Honestly,
 I didn't know it was called backtracking until after I was done lol.

 This is an implementation to the hard leetcode problem sudoku-solver (#37)
